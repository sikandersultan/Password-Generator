# <Password-Generator>
## Description
This small project was to help me learn how to use the basic functionality of Javascript to create a random password generator based on a few critera that the user chooses. I did learn a lot about using arrays in different ways in this assignment and although im still not sure how exactly math works in java code, I do understand the fundamentals of it. This code does check if the entered credentials are usable, but cannot fix it without a reload to the website.

The critera to complete for this project were as follows:

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
